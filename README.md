# GSM-based-Fire-Alert-System-Using-Arduino-NodeMCU-and-Fire-Detector-Sensor

Safety has become the watchword throughout all spheres of life. Governments, organizations, and individuals now understand the importance of safety and continue to devise means to ensure its implementation across all walks of life. Natural and man-made disasters, which are predominantly unpredictable, have the capacity to cause untold loss of lives and properties. To cope with the unpredictable nature of disasters, man designed systems that can send danger alerts early enough so that preventive steps can be taken to avert colossal loss of lives and properties.
